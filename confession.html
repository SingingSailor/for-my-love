    <h1>My Confession ðŸ–¤</h1>
    <p>
        Maybe I didn't fall in love with you right away, but you got close to me real quickly.<br><br>
        I donâ€™t know when it started. Maybe it was when we talked for hours and I didnâ€™t even notice time passing. 
        Maybe it was when you smiled at something dumb I said, and I realized how much I wanted to make you smile forever.<br><br>
        But I do know this: I love you, and I always will.
