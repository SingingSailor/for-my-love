            <p>I never knew I could feel this way about someone...</p>
            <p>You're the one who changed everything for me.</p>
            <p>No matter what, I want you to know you're truly special.</p>
            <p>Every moment with you feels like a dream, and I never want to wake up from it.</p>
            <p>I don‚Äôt know what the future holds, but I know I want you in mine.</p>
            <p>You're my safe place, my favorite thought, and the reason behind my happiest smiles.</p>
            <p>I hope this little page reminds you of how much you mean to me.</p>
