            <h1>My Love Letter to You ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
            <p>INFP? I asked. Who knew that would be the most important question I ever asked you, the one that led me to you‚Äîthe love of my life, whom I will cherish forever. I love you so, so much. I don't have the words for it.</p>
            <p>I just wanna be your <strong>FORD CORTINA</strong>. But hey, I'm also fine with being your boyfriend only. You light up my world like no one else could.</p>
            <p>Our late-night talks, our lame internal jokes‚Äîlike the umbrella dress (it looks like an umbrella with two legs), your buffalo-looking vagina haha. I‚Äôd never forget how you impacted my life in such a good way. I love you so much.</p>
            <p>I‚Äôd give you my heart, my love, my life in a matter of milliseconds if ever required. I‚Äôll keep you safe, I‚Äôll take care of you.</p>
            <p>Your smile is one of the most precious things in the world‚ÄîI‚Äôll never let it fade away. If you ever bleed, I'll bleed with you. I'll always be with you, in our darkest and brightest days. And even if I'm not there physically, just look at the things you love, or maybe visit this again, in the hopes that I'll be back to you, because I know I will be.</p>
            <p><strong>Yours, only yours dearly,</strong><br>  
            <strong>Boyfriend.</strong></p>
