    <h1>My Love Letter to You ❤️</h1>
    <p>INFP? I asked. Who knew that would be the most important question I ever asked you, the question that led me to you, the love of my life. I love you so, so much. I don't have the words for it.</p>
    
    <p>I just wanna be your FORD CORTINA. But hey, I'm also fine with being just your boyfriend. You light up my world like no one else could.</p>

    <p>Our late-night talks, our lame inside jokes—like umbrella dress (it looks like an umbrella with two legs), your buffalo-looking vagina haha. I'd never forget how you impacted my life in such a beautiful way. I love you so much.</p>

    <p>I'd give you my heart, my love, my life in a matter of milliseconds if ever required. I'll keep you safe, I'll take care of you.</p>

    <p>Your smile is one of the most precious things in the world, and I'll never let it fade away. If you ever bleed, I'll bleed with you. I'll always be with you, in our darkest and brightest days. And even if I'm not there physically, just look at the things you love, or maybe visit this again, in the hopes that I'll be back to you—because I know I will be.</p>

    <p>Yours, only yours dearly.<br>Boyfriend.</p>
